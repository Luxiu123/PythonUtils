我们被耍了
We're fucked! We are fucked.

762
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,300
妈的 他们在佛洲坐热太阳
Sitting in that hot-ass sun

763
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:08,800
我们却要坐在这寒冷的冰雪中
while we sit here ass deep in motherfuckin' snow.

764
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:14,400
再回去看看不知道会怎样?
What if we went down there?

765

你在鬼扯些什么?
What the fuck are you sayin'?

767
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:23,600
你想你可以攀得上关系吗?
We ask some room clerk at some hotel for a connection?

768
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:25,650
你不把握机会吗?
You saying you can't nose out some dope

769
01:05:25,651 --> 01:05:27,600
当货来的时候
when it's around?

770

如果我们马上回去的话
And if we get there right away

772
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:34,700
要卖多少价格就由我们来订
we can name our own price,

773
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:37,900
还可让那群白痴为我们上街头
and have those fools cover the street for us.

774
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,319
是呀 老兄
Yeah, man.

775
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:44,900
去年夏天真他妈的开心 不是吗?

了至去年夏天
since last summer, man.

778
01:05:53,330 --> 01:05:55,500
我们会再像那时一样的 老兄
It'll be like that again, man.

779
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:02,000
我可以叫安杰拉给我们简短的
I could get Angel to get us a short...

780
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:04,900
如果我们能保证给他高档海洛因

Some dumb-ass junkie did what?! You fucked up?!

787
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,082

- What the fuck is wrong with you?

788
01:07:43,083 --> 01:07:45,900
- 你保证过不会有问题的! 记得吗?
- You promised it was gonna be OK.

789
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,042
我为了你跟那个混球搞
I fucked that sleaze-bag.

790
01:07:48,043 --> 01:07:49,900
为了你我什么都做了!
I put myself through hell for you!

791
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,762
- 就是没有货嘛!
- There's nothing out there!

792
01:07:51,763 --> 01:07:54,700
- 我才不管! 妈的死无赖!
